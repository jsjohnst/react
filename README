To compile, do the standard `make` routine

To run, the program expects two input parameters.
The first param is the filemanager.txt file which
describes the job to run. The second param is the
output file to write the results into.

Examples of a dataset and control files are inside
the sampledata/ directory. To start React using that
data, simply use the following command line:

../React filemanager.txt output.txt
